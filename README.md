# Java-8
Java 8 introduced several important features and enhancements to the language. Here are the main features introduced in Java 8:

1. Lambda Expressions: Lambda expressions provide a concise way to represent anonymous functions and enable functional programming in Java.

2. Stream API: The Stream API allows for efficient processing of collections and sequences of data by providing a declarative approach for filtering, transforming, and performing aggregate operations on data.

3. Default Methods: Default methods enable adding methods to interfaces without breaking compatibility with existing implementations, allowing for the evolution of interfaces without requiring changes in all implementing classes.

4. Optional: The Optional class provides a container object to represent the presence or absence of a value. It helps avoid null pointer exceptions and provides a more expressive way to handle potentially absent values.

5. Functional Interfaces: Functional interfaces represent single abstract methods and can be used with lambda expressions and method references. Java 8 introduced several built-in functional interfaces in the `java.util.function` package.

6. Method References: Method references provide a shorthand notation for referring to existing methods or constructors, allowing for more concise code when working with functional interfaces.

7. Date and Time API: Java 8 introduced the `java.time` package, which provides a comprehensive set of classes for date and time manipulation, making it easier to work with dates, times, and time zones.

8. Default Time Zone: The `ZoneId` class allows for specifying the default time zone, making it easier to work with dates and times across different time zones.

9. CompletableFuture: The `CompletableFuture` class provides a powerful mechanism for asynchronous programming and composing asynchronous operations, enabling easier handling of concurrent and asynchronous tasks.

10. Parallel Streams: Java 8 introduced the ability to process streams in parallel, leveraging multi-core processors and improving performance for computationally intensive tasks.

11. Nashorn JavaScript Engine: The Nashorn JavaScript engine is a lightweight, high-performance JavaScript runtime built into Java 8, providing improved integration between Java and JavaScript.

These features have significantly enhanced the capabilities of the Java programming language and opened up new possibilities for developers in terms of writing more expressive, concise, and efficient code.
